**Summary**  
This presentation addresses architecture design considerations for real-time performance which enabled the semi-autonomous control of the Valkyrie robot for the DARPA Robotics Challenge. A middleware with a basis in the Whole Body Control (WBC) task-prioritized controller--and later extended to support other algorithms--was designed for rapid re-parametrization of the controller by either on-line planning modules or human operators. To achieve the fast servo rates necessary for closed-loop control of high DoF systems, a multi-threading approach was used to optimize the software. We also discuss our experiences and practical considerations in closed-loop control of series elastic humanoid robots.
