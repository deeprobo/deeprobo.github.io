### H3

Here's a line for us to start with.

This line is separated from the one above by two newlines, so it will be a *separate paragraph*.

This line is also a separate paragraph, but...  
This line is only separated by a single newline and a line break character, so it's a separate line in the *same paragraph*.

Emphasis, aka italics, with *asterisks* or _underscores_.

{% highlight java %}
	
private void foo(String argument)
{
 // Do something
 int i = 0;
 double num = 0.9;
}

{% endhighlight %}
