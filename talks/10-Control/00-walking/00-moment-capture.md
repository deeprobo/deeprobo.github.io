**Summary**  
We present our new momentum-based whole body control framework for floating base robots, the capturabality-based high level control, and the application to the 'Atlas' humanoid robot. The core of this control framework is the combination of a quadratic program and a recursive Newton-Euler algorithm. From a set of desired motion constraints, rate of change of momentum objective, and ground contact information, the core calculates the desired joint torques to be applied on the robot. We'll present how in the walking controller, these desired inputs are computed based on the capturability framework. Finally, the application to real hardware will be shown through the robot 'Atlas'.
