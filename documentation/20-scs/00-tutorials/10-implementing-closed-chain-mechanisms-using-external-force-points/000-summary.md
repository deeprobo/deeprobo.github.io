In the previous tutorial we created a simulation of a brick falling on a wavy ground.  
In this tutorial we will be creating a Flyball Governor using links, external force points, and shapes.  
You will gain more experience with specifying closed chain mechanisms, rotation, and torque.   

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the [Ground Contact Modeling] tutorial.
