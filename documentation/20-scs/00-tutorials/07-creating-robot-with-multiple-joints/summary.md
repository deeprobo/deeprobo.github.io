In this tutorial, we will create a simulation of a child's mobile toy, using a tree structure of 21 gimbal joints (63 degrees of freedom total). 

Figure 6 shows a screen shot of the mobile simulation. In this tutorial you will gain more experience with specifying joint offsets, and link translations and rotations.
