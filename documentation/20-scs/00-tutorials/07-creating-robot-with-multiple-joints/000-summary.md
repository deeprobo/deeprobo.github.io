In the previous tutorial we had created various shapes and added them to a link.
In this tutorial, we will create a simulation of a child's mobile toy, using a tree structure of 21 gimbal joints (63 degrees of freedom total).  
You will gain more experience with specifying joint offsets, and link translations and rotations. 

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the [Creating Links] tutorial.
