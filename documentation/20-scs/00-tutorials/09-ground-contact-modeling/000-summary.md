In the previous tutorial we had created a model of a child's toy mobile using links, shapes, and gimbal joints.
In this tutorial, we will create a simulation of a brick falling on a wavy ground.
You will gain more experience with specifying ground contact, terrain, and damping. 

This tutorial assumes that you have completed the [Creating a Robot with Multiple Joints] tutorial.
