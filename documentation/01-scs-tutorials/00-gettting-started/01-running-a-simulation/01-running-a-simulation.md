title: Running a simulation

---

Now that the software is installed, let's try running a simulation. The following tutorial will take you through some of the features of the simulation graphical user interface (GUI).
The GUI provides the user with a 3D graphical image of the Simulation; it allows changing of variables using numerical entry boxes; it allows for the real-time plotting of variables;
and it allows for the export and import of data, the creation of jpeg snapshots, and QuickTime movies. Please, make sure you grab all the required files (described below) from SVN Repository accordingly.
Do not attempt to continue without these files. You will need to checkout these projects and files from the SVN Repository (https://bengal.ihmc.us/svn/RobotControl/*, https://bengal.ihmc.us/svn/ExampleSimulations/* ).
These files are also available from http://ihmc.us/groups/scs.
Run the example simulation in the ExampleSimulations -> SpringFlamingo directory. A simulation of Spring Flamingo, a bipedal walking robot developed at the MIT Leg Laboratory, should appear. 
The simulation should resemble Figure 1.
Look around and familiarize yourself with the interface. A menu bar is on the top of the screen. A 3D graphical window showing the robot is below that. Below the 3D window is a toolbar with buttons for the most common functions.
 On the bottom left are variable panels containing lists of all the simulation and control variables. To the right of the variable panels are graph windows for graphing any variable. On the bottom are numeric entry boxes for changing the value of variables.
Start the simulation by either going to Simulate under the Run menu or by pressing the Simulate button worddav64a96cff021df97e7d26153d9dccf10d.png [imported from a Word document] on the toolbar. 
The robot will start walking, the variable values in the variable panels will update, and the variable graphs will start filling with data.
After letting the simulation run for a few seconds, stop it by either going to Run->Stop on the menu bar or by pushing the stop button worddav7ee30db0d6e7a5804d3202f63e6b3528.png [imported from a Word document] .
 The simulation should now stop.
Replay the simulated data by either going to Run->Play on the menu or by pushing the play button worddavc3349db686adcf9d8ba957577b0bb2cd.png [imported from a Word document] . 
The simulated data will be played back in the 3D graphics window in real time.
