title: Run the simulation
---
 
1. Make sure that your editor does not complain about any compilation issues and that all imports are specified. 
2. Run the simulation
3. As before, look for the q_FulcrumPin variable in the search tab of the Variable Viewer, create a new graph and drag the q_FulcrumPin into it.
4. Click the `Simulate` button. This time the pendulum should start moving and very rapidly stabilize toward its desired angle position value.      
5. Zoom in a little, notice that the graph accurately shows the trajectory of the pendulum at each time step. 

You can now experiment different initial parameters and controller gains.
