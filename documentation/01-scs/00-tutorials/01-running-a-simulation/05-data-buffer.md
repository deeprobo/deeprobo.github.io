Figure 5: Data Buffer Properties Dialog.
The data buffer can be made smaller by cropping it to the in point and out point.
Choose a window of data that you'd like to crop and set the in point to the beginning of the window worddavbf5ede9f731d2eb19ad8e4d52d916b54.png [imported from a Word document] and the out point to the end of the window worddava23084bba63cf7a9ba64adbc7f3f5b5a.png [imported from a Word document] . 
Then go to Data Buffer->Crop Buffer to In/Out in the menu. The data should be cropped to the window you selected.
Sometimes you may wish to move the data so that the in point is the first index but you don't wish to crop the data.
To do this, go to Data Buffer->Pack Buffer to In/Out on the menu. This will rotate the data in the buffer so that the in point is "packed" to the left.
