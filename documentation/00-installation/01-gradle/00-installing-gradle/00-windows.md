title: Installing Gradle on Windows 7/8/10

---

Gradle has no automated installer. Windows users will need to follow the installation instructions for Gradle from their documentation <https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/installation.html>.

The installation involves editing your user PATH variable; this is only necessary if you wish to run Gradle from the command line. Often times, IDEs will allow you to point to where Gradle is installed. It may be sufficient to simply unpack the .zip archive if you plan to use an IDE.
