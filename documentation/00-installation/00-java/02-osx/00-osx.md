title: Installing Java on OS X

---

We currently provide support for OS X 10.11 El Capitan***\**** via the Oracle JDK, version 7 or higher: <http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html>

***\****: The software may work on OS X versions as far back as Mavericks, but we do not currently actively build/test on Mavericks or Yosemite machines.
