<ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What is your vision for yourself and your venture? *</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Our vision is to deploy artificial intelligence robots in close to 10 million homes all over the world within 5 years time frame. We want to use a subscription based model which eliminates the initial procuring costs for the robot and they can pay a monthly bill amount.we want to help farmers by assisting them and help economically backward people and people in remote villages better education and healthcare.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">our minimal viable product(MVP) we want to develop in 6 months and then we want to go for seed funding for product design and development hiring interns and full-time employees.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Give a brief synopsis about your Idea*</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">we are developing a prototype of an open-source artificial intelligence based robot with both software and hardware powered with advanced deeplearning,reinforcement learning and causal inference algorithems.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The controller used is NVidia Jetson TX1 embedded board and zed stereo camera and other sensors are interfaced and servo motors are actuated for bipod movement this is the basic skeleton for the prototype. once this is ready we can deploy the deep leaning algorithm in it.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Hardware: NVidia Jetson TX1 embedded board, zed stereo camera and RP LIDAR.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Software: Zed SDK, Zed ROS wrapper, ROS(Robotic operating system), OpenCV,Deep learning libraries</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Who is your customer? [Age Group, Income levels, geography etc.]*</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The customers are diverse in long run but initially, we are aiming only for the AI researchers, students and hobbyists to use the robot and extend the functionality by adding modules and building applications on top of it and later once it passes rigorous testing then it can be deployed for real-world scenarios and use cases. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">In long term, the robot should be able to perform following tasks </span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1. helping farmers in farming activities.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2. Teaching to students by sharing facts and information. </span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">3. Performing basic diagnostics and providing health care to remote villages where doctors are far from reach.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">4. Doing basic household tasks and acting as a personal assistant</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">5. Helping business in automating and reducing the human labour and workforce.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Why does solving the problem matters? Describe the impact of your solution in terms of efficiency, throughput, cost saving, etc.*</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The challenges faced by the researchers in terms of time and effort can be invested in research thus increasing the efficiency.This robot can have a very significant impact on the society and can reduce the human labour by automating the repeated and cumbersome tasks. Billions of dollars can be saved if it is deployed all over the world in large scale.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Describe the uniqueness of your product design (Novelty)*</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Today robots (which are using age-old hardware) are not intelligent and not able to perform even basic perception and control tasks. we are designing the world's first opensource deep learning based robot DeepGen1 and we have already developed an automation framework called AutoDL which automates the training, testing and verification of the datasets with various deep learning algorithms and then it will only generate the detailed results along with visualisation. It was open sourced under apache licence. For further details check https://github.com/DeepRoboticsResearch/AutoDL</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What is your core technical innovation?*</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">our core innovation is developing a robot using powerful embedded controller board which can run the artificial intelligence algorithms in realtime along with various sensors interfaced to it for perception and control which is not yet implemented fully by anyone.</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">The important part is complete platform both hardware along with software is openly available for further development.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Do you look at entrepreneurship as a career option?</strong></span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">yes, we want to build an advanced robotics research company which develops software and hardware for next-generation robots with general artificial intelligence using machine learning, deep learning and reinforcement learning we are in bootstrapping stage and once we have our MVP we want to launch our startup.</span></p>
<p><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>What Hardware products do you intend to use in the design of your solution?</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">1.Nvidia Jetson TX1 embedded board</span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">2.Stereolabs zed stereo camera </span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">3.RPLIDAR A2M8 360&deg; Laser Range Scanner </span><br /><span style="font-size: 14pt;">4.Biped BRAT Combo Kit (Autonomous) BotBoarduino Model Number: BRATCBU</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Is your product (Pure Software/App on Mobile device/Non Electronics/ Your custom Hardware) with/without software based Idea*</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;">Ours is a (mechanical chassis with electronics components combined) hardware implemented robot with software algorithms coded into the embedded microcontroller board.</span></p>
